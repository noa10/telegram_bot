## How to Test

1. **Telegram initData Validation**:
   - Use the Telegram Mini App in development mode
   - Check that API requests include the initData
   - Verify that requests without valid initData are rejected

2. **Webhook Support**:
   - Set NODE_ENV=production and WEBHOOK_URL in .env
   - Deploy to Vercel
   - Verify that the bot responds to commands

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Test API endpoints with invalid data
   - Verify that appropriate error messages are returned
   - Check that frontend displays error messages correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests for critical components
2. **Monitoring**: Add logging and monitoring for production
3. **Performance**: Optimize API calls and frontend rendering
4. **Accessibility**: Improve accessibility of the frontend
5. **Internationalization**: Add support for multiple languages
